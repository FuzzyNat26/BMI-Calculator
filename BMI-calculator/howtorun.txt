Before you start using this app, make sure you install Node.Js. To check if you already have it, type npm -v or node -v.
1. Open folder's directory in code editor, or terminal. (For example : C:\PROJECT C DRIVE\BMI-calculator).
2. Type npm i --save--dev electron
3. Since i already included the package.json file, you can straight up type npm start in your terminal to start the app.
4. Enjoy the app!

Notes:
1. Github limit the node_modules folder, so i can't upload the folder
2. You can use yarn command, but you need to delete package-lock.json and change it to yarn.lock (You can see yarn website for details).
3. Alternative, you can install the setup for windows. I set ASAR to False, so you can see the source code inside. Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1snfeEzO4oe7-ZI1G0JYfIONqlX71YIoD/view?usp=sharing
4. In package.json, I included electron-builder settings to build setup.exe file for windows. For Mac and Linux, you can edit the package.json file. (And of course, you need to download electron-builder inside the folder).
