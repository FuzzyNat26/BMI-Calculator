Before you start using this app, make sure you install Node.Js. To check if you already have it, type npm -v or node -v

1. Open folder's directory in code editor, or terminal. (For example : C:\PROJECT C DRIVE\BMI-calculator).
2. Type npm i --save-dev electron (Github limit the node_modules folder).
3. Since i already included the package.json file, you can straight up type npm start in your terminal to start using.
4. Enjoy the app!
