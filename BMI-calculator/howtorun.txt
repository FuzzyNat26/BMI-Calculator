Before you start using this app, make sure you install Node.Js. To check if you already have it, type npm -v or node -v.

1. Open folder's directory in code editor, or terminal. (For example : C:\PROJECT C DRIVE\BMI-calculator).
2. Type npm i --save-dev electron (Github limit the node_modules folder).
3. Since i already included the package.json file, you can straight up type npm start in your terminal to start using.
4. Enjoy the app!

Alternative, you can install the setup for windows. I set ASAR to False, so you can see the source code inside.

In package.json, I included electron-builder to build setup.exe file for this app (for windows). For Mac and Linux, you can edit the package.json file.
